# Data-Visualization-Signal-Processing

This was my 3rd lab for ECE 16 (Rapid hardware and software design for interfacing with the world)

The goal of this lab is to introduce you to methods for plotting sampled data from sensors and to basic signal processing methods that you can apply to clean up your EMG signal and extract signal features of interest

Objective One - Plot Raw & Scaled EMG Samples

Objective Two - Signal Filtering, Rectification, and Power Estimation 

Objective Three - Real-time Signal Processing on the Arduino!

Objective Four - Streaming Arduino Data!
